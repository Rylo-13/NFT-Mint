Rando-Mint NFT's

This is my first attempt at a fully functional and responsive NFT Dapp.

- Metamask connect/disconnect authentication

- Mint a random NFT via Goerli Testnet

- Sanity integration to have a full CMS platform.

- Deployed on the Vercel hosting platform

Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind & Thirdweb
