Rando-Mint NFT's

This is my first attempt at a fully functional and responsive NFT Dapp.

- Metamask connect/disconnect authentication

- Mint a random NFT via Goerli Testnet, viewable on Opensea

- ðŸ‘‰ How to implement toaster notifications & silky smooth loading animations!

- ðŸ‘‰ How to implement Sanity to have a full CMS platform which is customisable even when the website is live!

- Deployed on the Vercel hosting platform

Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind & Thirdweb
